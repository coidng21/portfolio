# Portfolio Website 

> Description 

The website has 4 main components: main page, about me page, projects page, and contact page. It is mainly built to introduce myself and projects I have done. It is built with React, javascript, html, and css. 

> Note

The about me page component's animation does not work if you are viewing the website with tablet or phone. It only works under laptop screen size. If you are using tablets, you can try to zoom out to see the proper animations. 

> Steps to install and run the application

1. git clone the repository to your terminal 
2. enter npm run start on your terminal command line

Hope you enjoy this website 😁
